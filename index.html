#
# NAME
#        PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions
#
# PCRE REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY
#
#        The  full  syntax  and  semantics  of  the regular expressions that are supported by PCRE are described in the
#        pcrepattern documentation. This document contains a quick-reference summary of the syntax.
#
# QUOTING

          \x         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
          \Q...\E    treat enclosed characters as literal

# CHARACTERS

          \a       # alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
          \cx      # "control-x", where x is any ASCII character
          \e       # escape (hex 1B)
          \f       # form feed (hex 0C)
          \n       # newline (hex 0A)
          \r       # carriage return (hex 0D)
          \t       # tab (hex 09)
          \077     # character with octal code 0dd
          \777     # character with octal code ddd, or backreference
          \o{777}  # character with octal code ddd..
          \xff     # character with hex code hh
          \x{fffe} # character with hex code hhh..

#        Note that \0dd is always an octal code, and that \8 and \9 are the literal characters "8" and "9".
#
# CHARACTER TYPES

          .        # any character except newline;
                   #   in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
          \C       # one data unit, even in UTF mode (best avoided)
          \d       # a decimal digit
          \D       # a character that is not a decimal digit
          \h       # a horizontal white space character
          \H       # a character that is not a horizontal white space character
          \N       # a character that is not a newline
          \p{Pi}   # a character with the xx property
          \P{Pi}   # a character without the xx property
          \R       # a newline sequence
          \s       # a white space character
          \S       # a character that is not a white space character
          \v       # a vertical white space character
          \V       # a character that is not a vertical white space character
          \w       # a "word" character
          \W       # a "non-word" character
          \X       # a Unicode extended grapheme cluster

#        By default, \d, \s, and \w match only ASCII characters, even in UTF-8 mode or in the 16- bit  and  32-bit  li‐
#        braries.  However,  if  locale-specific  matching  is happening, \s and \w may also match characters with code
#        points in the range 128-255. If the PCRE_UCP option is set, the behaviour of these escape sequences is changed
#        to use Unicode properties and they match many more characters.

# CHARACTER CLASSES

       [...]        # positive character class
       [^...]       # negative character class
       [x-y]        # range (can be used for hex characters)
       [[:word:]]   # positive POSIX named set
       [[:^word:]]  # negative POSIX named set

       [[:alnum:]]  # alphanumeric
       [[:alpha:]]  # alphabetic
       [[:ascii:]]  # 0-127
       [[:blank:]]  # space or tab
       [[:cntrl:]]  # control character
       [[:digit:]]  # decimal digit
       [[:graph:]]  # printing, excluding space
       [[:lower:]]  # lower case letter
       [[:print:]]  # printing, including space
       [[:punct:]]  # printing, excluding alphanumeric
       [[:space:]]  # white space
       [[:upper:]]  # upper case letter
       [[:word:]]   # same as \w
       [[:xdigit:]] # hexadecimal digit

#        In  PCRE,  POSIX  character set names recognize only ASCII characters by default, but some of them use Unicode
#        properties if PCRE_UCP is set. You can use \Q...\E inside a character class.

#        The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a backtrack to reach  them.  They  all  force  a
#        match  failure,  but they differ in what happens afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do so
#        only if the pattern is not anchored.

          (*COMMIT)     # overall failure, no advance of starting point

			`man pcrepattern` is much longer than `man pcresyntax`, which is why only its examples were reproduced below.

\040  # is another way of writing an ASCII space
\40   # is the same, provided there are fewer than 40 previous capturing subpatterns
\7    # is always a back reference
\11   # might be a back reference, or another way of writing a tab
\011  # is always a tab
\0113 # is a tab followed by the character "3"
\113  # might be a back reference, otherwise the character with octal code 113
\377  # might be a back reference, otherwise the value 255 (decimal)
\81   # is either a back reference, or the two characters "8" and "1"

\xdc is exactly the same as \x{dc}, or \u00dc in JavaScript mode.

[In addition, inside a character class, \b is interpreted as the backspace character (hex 08).]

[\N is not allowed in a character class.]
[\B, \R, and \X are not special inside a character class.]

# In 8-bit non-UTF-8 mode \R is equivalent to the following:
(?>\r\n|\n|\x0b|\f|\r|\x85)
